This is a README file on the Project Metropolis simulation of an Ising model

compile with:
make

The usage of this program is based on a command line interface:
ising_ex <length of one axis of the grid> <dimension> <B-field>
	 <iterations> <Temperature> <equilibration time> <algorithm>
	 <output> <start> (in one line)
